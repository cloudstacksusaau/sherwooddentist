<h2>Study Busts Dental Myth And Concludes Dental Procedures Are Safe During The Pandemic</h2>
<p>
The study conducted at Ohio State’s College of dentistry saw a participation of 28 individuals who were scheduled to receive dental implants and dental restorations from May to July of 2020. High-speed drills and ultrasonic scaling were predominantly used during these procedures. The study also involved patients in who low levels of SARS-CoV-2 were detected. Samples of patients undergoing the treatment were collected before and 30 minutes after completing the treatment. The irritant solution was also analyzed. Patients were also asked to rinse their mouth with medicated mouthwash before treatment.

Furthermore, samples from the dentist’s face shield, patient’s bib, and area 6 feet away from the dental chair were collected. All of these samples were analyzed through genomic sequencing to explore the microbial flora in them. They saw that the genetic composition of these organisms matched the organism naturally present in the environment. No traces of coronavirus was seen in the aerosol.

These conclusions are of extreme value for people in need of dental treatments but cannot get them due to the fear of the virus. Moreover, it is seen that people with good oral health have lower infectivity and recover faster than people with poor oral health. Maintaining good oral hygiene combined with regular dental checkups at our clinic is more critical now than it was ever.
